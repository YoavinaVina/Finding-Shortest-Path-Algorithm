Finding the Shortest Path Algorithm
This code implements an algorithm that finds the shortest path from one point to another. You can even draw obstacles to make it more challenging for the algorithm.

The first point you create (orange) is the goal, and the second one (cyan) is the player.

After placing the goal and the player, you can add obstacles. The player cannot pass through obstacles, so it will have to find an alternate path.
Once you have set the player, the goal, and optionally the obstacles, press Enter to activate the algorithm.

The purple path that appears is the shortest path between the player and the goal.

If you want to restart press 'c' on your keyboard.

Notes
You can delete the goal, player, or obstacles by left-clicking on them.
If you press Enter without setting the positions of both the player and the goal, the algorithm will not start.
Have fun! :)
